# Important Notes
### Note 1: API Access Limitation
I am currently using the Developer Plan for the News API, which only permits API calls from localhost (local development environment).

- #### CORS Enabled for Localhost Only: 
Due to this restriction, you will not be able to make API requests from deployed (live) applications.
- #### Apology: 
I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause when accessing the API from the live website.

### Note 2: Login Wait Time
When you enter the login credentials, the login process may take a few seconds. Please be patient and allow the time for successful authentication.
